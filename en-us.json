These successive traffic accidents in the same location have sparked speculation. And in order to dispel the doubts in people's minds, the local government made an urgent statement after a traffic accident that just happened early this morning, saying that the multiple traffic accidents on the bridge are not related to the infrastructure, and the results of the investigation of the first traffic accident that has been completed so far indicated that the accident was purely accidental. The investigation of the remaining several traffic accidents is still in progress, and the roadway is still accessible to normal traffic, so please don't have any doubts. \n\nDespite the statement made by the local government as soon as possible, there is still a group of people on the Internet who insist on the statement that the bridge is magical while asking the government to close the road as well as repairing the defects of the bridge. However, the mayor ignored such statements, while the officials of the Ministry of Transportation reveal that they are bidding for the restoration team of the bridge and are expected to complete the restoration work within 3 months. During that time, they chose to keep the roadway open in order not to affect the normal travel needs of the public. Minister of Transportation Dbut Qbx said, “We take full account of the daily travel needs of our residents and do what we can to safeguard our human rights to travel normally, whether it's people of color, white, refugee, LGBT, labor, all deserve equal access to the right to travel freely.”\n",

In his lifetime he was also trying to run for the local mayor, and it is known that he was traveling to pull votes from the southern region. \n\nAfter his death in the lake, the Ministry of Transportation learned a painful lesson and took quick measures to block off the road.

Inuit religion is actually a kind of primitive animism, or animism. They believe that everything in the world has a life and a soul. The Eskimos deeply believe that there are many supermaterial souls in heaven and earth that govern everything in nature; that souls can transcend material appearances and can enter or leave the human body or any other objects; that souls still exist even if matter is destroyed, which contributes to why it currently has a very high popularity on the Internet.

    "bb027fca2c889be9c104f95640a034db": "While online games help adolescents improve spatial cognitive ability, improve problem solving ability, effectively allocate attention, reduce negative emotions, exercise social interaction skills, learn teamwork, and enhance social adaptability, they also have negative effects that cannot be ignored. If adolescents are overly immersed in online games, they may develop problematic behaviors such as uncontrollable online game use time and emotional instability. It leads to the damage of physical and mental health, poor academic performance, weakened moral normality and damaged realistic social relationships among adolescents.<br/><br/>How to guide young people to rationally plan the use of online games and bring into play their positive effects while reducing their negative effects is an issue of great concern from the government to schools and families. One of the prerequisites to solve this problem is to understand why some adolescents are addicted to online games and have problematic behaviors, whether it is a problem of game settings, individual adolescents' reasons, or whether it contains a combination of psychological, social and cultural factors? In this regard, this study proposes a three-factor culture-society-individual model to explain the causes of adolescents' problem behaviors in online games from the perspective of social psychology. The model suggests (as shown in Figure 1) that adolescents' problematic behaviors from online games are the result of the tripartite interaction of socio-cultural environment, social change and individual psychological needs, and when the change of social upbringing is not in line with the pace of social change, adolescents are more likely to be overly immersed in the virtual world to seek psychological satisfaction and produce online game problematic behaviors. \n<br/><br/><center><img src=\"images/Props/Industry20/leoIMG.webp\" style=\"position:relative;width:100%;\"/></center>\n<br/>Impulse control is one of the key themes of traditional social indoctrination. The Confucian cultural tradition emphasizes social control, and children are required early on to have the ability to control their impulses, both as an important way for them to practice filial piety and as a prerequisite for their later academic success. Under the Confucian tradition, impulses are immoral and must be repressed. The notion of impulse control is concerned with whether the behavior is moral, <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>not with the psychological triggers of the impulse</b>. Influenced by this view, parents' indoctrination of their children also emphasizes control of individual impulses and respect and obedience to authority in order to be consistent with filial piety. As a result, many parents focus only on evaluating the morality of their children's behavior <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>and ignore their children's psychological needs</b>. Parents have little respect and trust for their children, are very hegemonic, and have a strong sense of authority, which results in a parent-child relationship that is not strong. Children growing up in this culture are often unwilling or unable to identify and acknowledge their own physical and psychological needs, or even feel guilty for their impulses stemming from basic physical or psychological needs, and are more likely to develop problem behaviors. It has been shown that authoritarian parenting styles are positively associated with adolescent Internet addiction. \n<br/><br/>Another important theme in traditional Chinese social indoctrination is achievement, which is the expression of glorious ancestry, and children recognize the importance of academic success very early in the social indoctrination process. When it comes to healthy growth, people think of “growing the body and knowledge”, but rarely think of “growing the mind”. Equating growth with physical health and intellectual development at the expense of spiritual growth. If the body is healthy and learning is good, the heart is satisfied. In the eyes of parents, children are grown-up children, and “children” should concentrate on their studies and not think about things that distract them; at the same time, parents have the responsibility to guide their children to think about “the right things to think about” and stop them from thinking about “the wrong things to think about.” Under this concept, parents not only do not share their ideas with their children as equals, but also fundamentally deny the rationality of their children's emotional aspirations and life exploration, and do not guide their children to understand and appreciate the complexity of social life. However, as children develop physically and mentally, it is natural for them to have some emotional worries and needs, and to think about issues that are not related to “reading” or exams, but are closely related to their growth. These worries may be repressed for a while, but they cannot be eliminated. Parents become a barrier rather than a bridge between their children and society, allowing their children to spend more time studying for exams, causing emotional repression of their children and adding emotional pain to them. Parents often place a lot of emphasis on their children's grades and <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>fail to pay attention to their children's stresses and needs, and lack understanding of their children's lives beyond their academic performance</b>, which may be a major reason for their children's problematic behaviors.\n<br/><br/>To explain the online game problematic behaviors of adolescents, it is inevitable to consider the factors of adolescents themselves, and in the model proposed in this paper, the focus is on the psychological needs of adolescents themselves. The model argues that online games are one of the ways in which adolescents satisfy their psychological needs, and what makes some adolescents addicted to online games is their inability to find other ways to satisfy their psychological needs on their own, thus explaining their dependence on them. The analysis of which psychological needs adolescents have can be understood in light of the three basic human needs proposed by Dweck (2017). These basic needs are predictability - the need for predictability in the world, to reduce uncertainty, to know how the world works; competence - a need to improve one's strengths, to learn how to act in the world; and acceptance - the need to be accepted and loved, to want to be responded to by others in times of need.\n<br/><br/><b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>The online gaming experience meets exactly the basic psychological needs of adolescents and alleviates the conflicting conflicts they face in real life. </b>First, adolescents <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>have control over themselves in the game world, and these can reduce uncertainty and satisfy the need for predictability.</b>Second, gaming is a way to socialize, both with other players in the game world to build friendships, and with real-life classmates and friends through gaming to gain respect and care and to satisfy the need for acceptance. Finally, <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>it is easier to gain a sense of accomplishment in the game world. It is easier and more fun to upgrade and compete in games than in real life, and one can also get instant rewards and rewards back, satisfying the need to get recognition for one's abilities.</b>\n<br/><br/>(Excerpted from Wenjun Gao: A Three-Factor Analysis of the Cultural-Social-Individual Factors of Youth Online Game Problem Behavior.

This inspired me how the occurrence of post-traumatic stress in adolescents really needs to be done, and how the occurrence of post-traumatic stress in non-adolescents can arise. It is important to think clearly about how adolescents' post-traumatic stress response is really a kind of existence. However, even so, the presence of adolescent post-traumatic stress represents a certain significance. Generally speaking, it is important to consider it carefully. How does the occurrence of post-traumatic stress in adolescents need to be done, and how does the occurrence of post-traumatic stress in adolescents need to be done, and how does the occurrence of post-traumatic stress in adolescents not occur. Everyone has to face these problems. In the face of such problems, given how, in summary, we generally believe that if we catch the key to the problem, everything else will be solved. Now, it is very, very important to address the issue of post-traumatic stress in adolescents. So, in life, if post-traumatic stress in adolescents is present, we have to consider the fact that it is present. It's important to think about what kind of existence the post-traumatic stress reaction in adolescents is. Why does post-traumatic stress occur in adolescents? We have to face a very embarrassing fact, that is, how adolescent post-traumatic stress should be realized. The key to the so-called post-traumatic stress response in adolescents is how the post-traumatic stress response in adolescents needs to be written. Generally speaking, to sum up, Belinsky said a philosophical phrase, good books are the most valuable treasures. This doesn't stop me from thinking about it. With these questions in mind, let's examine the post-traumatic stress response of adolescents. With these questions in mind, let's examine the post-traumatic stress response of adolescents. Feng Xuefeng once mentioned that when a person meets the light with work, the light will soon come to shine on him. This inspired me, after the above discussion. \n",

While loading and unloading at Yangshan Port in Shanghai, the driver of the stevedoring company made an error which caused the container to fall from a high altitude, with 10,000 bottles of red wine broken in the process.\n\nSince Rudy has signed sales and purchase contracts with two domestic companies, if the sales are successful, it will benefit nearly 500,000 yuan. Unfortunately, the red wine is now all gone and cannot be sold. Not only can no profit be obtained, but a penalty of 100,000 yuan has to be compensated for the breach of contract. \n\nIn January 2016, Rudy filed a lawsuit against the stevedoring company to Shanghai Maritime Court, demanding a total of more than 770,000 yuan in compensation for loss of goods and freight forwarding fees.\n\nAfter the trial, the Shanghai Maritime Court held that the stevedoring company, as a port operator, was at fault for the improper operation at the port, and that the act was also causally related to the occurrence of cargo damage. Therefore, the stevedoring company, as the infringing party, should compensate Rudy for the damages caused by its infringement according to law. The scope of compensation for the tortious liability of the stevedoring company shall be limited to the scope of its loss, which should be foreseen at the time of the damage. The two wine sales contracts alleged by Rudy are the rights and obligations between it and the outsider. The stevedoring company had no knowledge of the loss and did not have a foreseeable possibility of the loss. Therefore, this part of Rudy's loss is not supported.    \n",

    "cf342419cb8f9665a6714eeee0d3ce92": "As we all know, with the improvement of people's living standards in modern society, midnight drinking has now become the talk of the town after dinner. I believe we are all familiar with wine - it is what will often encounter every day. But what about midnight drinking? Today let me show you what benefits it holds for us. <br/><br/>\nWe all know that red wine has many benefits for the human body. It can improve blood circulation, and from the perspective of Asian-exclusive food therapy it can also improve the operation of qi and blood, and can also play a good role in removing the body's coldness and enhance the yang. For people with cold hands, feet, and limbs, drinking more red wine can play a good role in driving the cold away and maintaining warmth. Moreover, red wine also contains many polyphenols or flavonoids, including resveratrol, an antioxidant, which can also play a positive role in anti-oxidation, scavenging free radicals, and anti-aging. Therefore, people who drink more red wine often sleep better, and will have a more obvious anti-aging effect. Therefore, frequent drinking of red wine in the middle of the night is conducive to promoting good health, allowing your kids to grow rapidly, acquire straight A's in exams and of course, maximum emotional damage prevention. Young people will strive to become great doctors, middle-aged people will gain the energy to practice 40 hours a day, and the elderly will become weightlifters and prolong their lives. In order to return everyone’s love over the years, we deliberately produced the best-selling French Léo est stupide 36-year-old red wine, aged from 1936 to the present. Not only does it taste more pure and rich, but its health value is even favored by many old Asian doctors, who regarded it as pure oriental medicine. But we do not sell them for $9999 here, neither $999 nor $99. Only 69 dollars. Some family members asked why I sell them at such a low price. People say that wine does not come from trees, but let me tell you, it comes from sugar. You find sugar you find wine. And sugar grows on trees (fruits). With this secret recipe, I was able to create a never-ending wine supply chain, so feel free to buy it for a cheap price. You can start by scanning the two-dimensional code below, and all the transactions will be done for you. Then let us drink together under the moonlight, forgetting all the greed and scams in the world. \n<br/><center><img src=\"images/Props/Industry20/fakeCode.webp\" style=\"position:relative;width:100%;\"/></center>",

It is reported that they have been working on a game called 《I'm not quite sure what to name the game as but I know that it has to be as long as possible preferably longer than Dexterion The Ultimate Annihilator of the evil dominion Under Cyborg Demon’s Armageddon Battle Fate of the cryptic world in cybernetic trooper’s hands then we can at least go to the Oscars with the longest game name ever then tell the artist to draw a waifu a day so that players will charge money to get the waifu and incidentally the new waifu gacha rate should be lowered a little but not too low there's no need to make a guaranteed pity system but we have to claim that we have one and it's best to give them an outdated waifu from time to time so that they will continue to charge money to get a new waifu well today although I haven't thought of a good name but we still made a lot of breakthroughs so we'll end the meeting here lmao》for a month, writing more than millions of code lines, which do not include the parts that were modified back and forth according to the needs of Party A.\n\nAccording to their in-house artist For River, their boss is extremely outrageous: “He's not the type that order me to draw something unattainable. He just, let me create whatever I want without any explanation, but when I was done, he repeatedly argued that it wasn't suitable and had to be changed. Can't these requirements be mentioned in advance?” Another programmer who did not want to be named also said: “His demands are extremely outrageous. One time he asked that the game UI color needs to change based on real-life day and night, weather, environmental temperature, player's computer case color and even their mood, but there isn't any corresponding API for these things. We raised objections, he will first pretend to compromise, and then secretly add these things into the requirements document. And the thing is that although our team is big, the salary is still low, only 1276 dollars a month, while he himself built eight three-storey villas outside. When he came back to the company, he still didn't stop being an advocate of idealism. He kept pursuing his original intentions even when we can't even rent the basement now. My girlfriend and I almost got married, but in the end we couldn’t make ends meet because of the financial difficulties. And when I tried to resign he even carried out physical threats. This isn't idealism, it's f**cking terrorism. (This interview is far off-topic, but there is certainly a lot of juicy tidbits, so let's try to contact him first. Use this interview to threaten the other party and let him make money to delete it. Once the job is done we'll split it 30/70)”\n\nAlthough such a major change has occurred in Reap Games, this afternoon, the person in charge of the game project spoke out in response to the incident: “After an internal investigation, we believe that his suicide was due to his own psychological reasons and had nothing to do with our company. Our team is still feeling positive and we're working very hard to present a better game. Fans need not to worry, as the update speed of our new game content won't be affected, so please look forward to our new version update!”",

    "aae4e02fa0584d3d0ee6fa2bf0e63e03": "Kabbalah Tree of Life is a part of Kabbalah, Traditional Judaism philosophy. It is located at the centre of the Garden of Eden, is a pathway for mankind to gods and the way They create a world out of nothing. In contrast, the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the way gods have fallen and become men. Adam and Eva were expelled from the Garden of Eden by Them after eating the forbidden fruit and gaining the ability to distinguish the Good and Evil. They lost the qualifications to be gods and became the primal humans in the world they are now. <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>If humans want to become gods, they need to win the Devil inside themselves. Then with great power and victory over the angels, they can successfully return to where the gods reside.</b>\n<br><br>The tree of life usually consists of 10 nodes symbolizing different archetypes and 22 lines connecting the nodes. In Jewish Kabbalah, these nodes - 'sephiroth' - usually represent encompassing aspects of existence, God, or the human psyche. The nodes are also associated to deities, angels, celestial bodies, values, single colors or combinations of them, and specific numbers. The first sefirah, Keter, describes the divine superconscious Will that is beyond conscious intellect. The next three sefirot (Chokhmah, Binah and Da'at) describe three levels of conscious divine intellect. In particular, Da'at represents Keter in its knowable form, the concept of knowledge. Will and knowledge are corresponding somewhat dependent opposites. The seven subsequent sefirot (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malkuth) describe the primary and secondary conscious divine emotions. The sefirot of the left side and the sefira of Malkuth are feminine, as the female principle in Kabbalah describes a vessel that receives the outward male light, then inwardly nurtures and gives birth to the sefirot below them.\n",

They were carved by hundreds of sculptors from the City of London over several months, and their cost and production time are among the world's largest. The statues are a collection of all memorable figures from the founding of the United Kingdom to the present day, who have laid the foundation stone for the present prosperity of the British Empire.\n\nWhile accompanying the people to the Statue Forest, she did not forget her mission. Under the statue of King John from the House of Plantagenet, she gave a stirring speech in which she thanked the British people for choosing her to guide all of them. The Prime Minister and the Mayor of London then followed with deep greetings to the people and a great respect for British history.\n\nAnother heavyweight, the head of the Statue Forest project, Dbut Qbx, Minister for Transport of the London Government, chose to give his speech under the statue of Thatcher. He claimed that it is under the role of the free market, it is under the government's effective policy of opening up and cutting costs, it is under the powerful role of capital, especially with the help of advanced technology, that allows the flow of information to accelerate. And it is because they insist on moving forward on the path of neo-liberalism which Thatcher started that London today has such a prosperous and beautiful new scene. “People out there often say that the UK is a tax haven for the rich, but all that is not accurate. The UK is a haven for everyone who comes here, whether they are coloured, white, refugee, LGBT, labour, even if they are country bumpkins trying to arch a cabbage. They are all given the freedom they were born with to work their way to a happier life. As long as you do not rely on our welfare to make ends meet, do not choose to be lazy, and always compete with others who work harder and harder, they could easily pursue happiness in London, while I looked at them constantly working and competing, full of envy.” It is reported that his campaign is very popular with the Queen, and this will greatly benefit his next campaign for the mayor of London.\n",

The driver was unable to save the feral cat and crashed a street light due to its dimness, despite his attempts to dodge it. Although the feral cat was taken to the nearest vet hospital for treatment as quickly as possible after discovery, it still died of an infected wound. The person in question uploaded the corresponding post online. They complained that the local red light was too long and that the injured feral cat might have been saved if the light had been green all the way. The posting sparked huge controversy on the internet, and within minutes, animal lovers were strongly condemning the driver, including but not limited to “Are you blind? The cat is so big why couldn't you see it” “You ran into the red light anyway” “Red light time allocation is very reasonable, I think the Ministry of Transport isn't at fault, it's you on the road intentionally delaying time” “Just die and be buried with the cat” and a series of statements. After only two hours, the driver's personal address was found. Animal lovers gathered outside his home for a half-day-long strong protest, and strongly urged the local police to come out. The local police were unable to cope with their harassment, resulting in the man symbolically detained for half a day after the protest. At the end of detention, the driver was overwhelmed by cyber-violence and fought back against the verbal abuse from some animal lovers, which sparked even further public outrage from animal lovers. Finally, on March 18, on the initiative of @IsolatedIsland, they decided to file a lawsuit in the local court. They also opened an online crowdfunding channel to prepare funds for the lawsuit against the driver, and reached the crowdfunding amount on March 19. Meanwhile, lawyers who volunteered to help murdered cats had sprung up among animal lovers. On March 20, the local court made its first verdict on the case. The driver lost the case and was classified as a hit-and-run. He agreed to pay compensation to the Animal Protection Association and was required to perform a week of voluntary labor in the community. But the defense did not agree with this verdict, and they are now trying to file a further appeal to a higher court, and created the hashtag #CatKillerDriverIntentionalAssault on Twitter. There are already close to 100 million discussions within the topic and a new crowdfunding campaign has been opened. This morning, the Superior Court rejected the new appeal and asked the lower level to retry the case, sparking an outcry from animal lovers. They marched in front of the High Court of Justice, chanting the slogan “animal lives matter”, and were only dispersed in the afternoon. The driver had a nervous breakdown during this period and was forcibly taken to a local psychiatric hospital for appropriate treatment.",
    "6b4ea535dd85b172d720dcade2612f32": "Since the first traffic accident occurred on this bridge on March 23, this same road has had five large and small traffic accidents occur in the evening. Officials said that the police were trying to investigate the cause, but no results have been found in the subsequent traffic accidents. It caused controversy for some time, and some even think that this lake area has concentrated the grievances of the first victim's family, like some sort of curse. However, I believe that it is the serious negligence of the corresponding department in London that caused this series of tragedies.\n<br/><br/>\nNetizen @BS said he was a witness of the first accident, when he was at the other end of the bridge. Because the bridge was dark at the time, he had been using his cell phone's flashlight to light the path, which was when he saw a truck traveling in the same direction in this section. According to his recollections, the driver was not driving fast, but rather very smoothly. But when it passed him, he couldn't see, after which he heard a violent crash at the other end of the bridge.\n<br/><br/>\nI also personally walked this bridge once today when I was off work from JiangNanGame. What @BS said was true, it was difficult to walk without a flashlight. I even almost fell off the bridge through the gaping hole where the car crashed on my way home. I later conducted random interviews with people passing by this bridge at noon, and many claimed that <b class='LvlUI_Industry20Div'>even before March 16, when the street lights were completely damaged and it was night in London, the bridge was also very dimly lit, occasionally flickering, and not convenient for people to pass.</b> They actually reported the situation to the transportation department, but kept being told that there was not enough funding to solve this issue.\n<br/><br/>\nYet it is the old age of these traffic infrastructure that led to countless tragedies, one after another. Against the so-called DUI, no alcohol metabolites found in the driver's body is ironclad evidence. Moreover, the lack of investigation results for several subsequent accidents is also just a cover-up. The sensational and ridiculous move by animal advocates against the driver who struck and killed a feral cat is also all about distraction. Repairing street lights, repairing a bridge, obviously does not require a particularly large amount of money, yet people are repeatedly told about the lack of funding while they try to shirk responsibility. Whoever is behind all this, I'm sure it goes without saying.\n",

At present, the truck driver who caused the accident had been arrested and brought to justice. Among the family who crashed into the lake, an adult female and an adult male have died of ineffective treatment, while another underage male is still in emergency rescue.\n\nThe police are still unable to determine the cause of the truck driver’s retrograde crash. Initially, based on the broken wine bottles in the truck compartment and the diffuse alcohol gas, they initially concluded that it was due to the driver’s drunk driving, but no alcohol metabolites were detected in the driver’s body. After the incident, the man was emotionally stable and mentally normal except for the inability to recall the corresponding incident, and had no relationship with the victim. The police are still trying to investigate the cause of the accident.\n\nTwo adults out of the three victims have died despite rescue efforts. As the first one to be found and salvaged by the police, a minor male also suffered multiple scratches, with his head also had traces of suspected glass cuts. He is still in severe coma.\n",
